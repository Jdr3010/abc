Hi [FUCKU]

I hope this message finds you well.

Thank you for proposing a new date for our training session. Unfortunately, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accommodate the rescheduled training session on [New Date] due to personal reasons.

I kindly request your assistance in maintaining the original session date or rescheduling for another date. Please let me know your availability so we can find a suitable solution together.

Thank you for your understanding and patience. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Trainer's Name]
