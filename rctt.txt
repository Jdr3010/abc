Hi [FUCKU]
I hope this message finds you well.

Thank you for proposing a new date for our training session. Unfortunately, I regret to inform you that I am unable to accept the rescheduled date on [New Date] at this time due to personal reasons.

I kindly request your assistance in maintaining the original session date or rescheduling for another date. Please let me know if this is feasible or if we need to explore alternative options.

Thank you for your understanding and flexibility. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,

[Client's Name]
